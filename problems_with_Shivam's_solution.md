1. Point class doesn't have any behaviour(no methods).
2. As the code should contain fewer elements, no duplication, reveal intention, and passing of all the test cases, we can merge the two classes into one.
3. According to the requirement, setters and getters in point class are not required. X and Y fields being private are accessible in another class which effects encapsulation.
4. X and Y coordinates should be made final.
5. As the DistanseAndDirectionCalculator class has no fields,constructors and does contain static methods there is no need of that class.
6. Test class isn't follow AAA format. 
7. We can test two functionalities of the same object in one testcase by writing multiple asserts.
8. Should have used static import for assertEquals.
9. Using assertThat would make the code more readable.
10. Magic numbers in assertEquals.
